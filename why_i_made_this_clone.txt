The primary purpose of creating this Amazon clone was to:

- Gain hands-on experience with front-end.
- Implement features such as user product listings.



##:::::::::::::::::::::Learning Outcomes:::::::::::::::::::::::##

Throughout the process, I learned:

- The importance of responsive design and user experience.
- How to integrate a database for storing user and product information.
- Best practices for coding, debugging, and deploying a proper information to the document.
